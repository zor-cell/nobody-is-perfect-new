# Interactive Website template

This project serves as a template for the interactive websites I am creating for my [blog](https://zor-blog.netlify.app/).
The website is styled using plain **HTML5** and **CSS** and the logic is implemented using the **React.js** framework.
The **React.js** dependencies are loaded using the React CDN.
A local server can be used for testing, which is created using a **node.js** live-server.

## Usage
Start local development server (run in directory frontend): **npm run start**
